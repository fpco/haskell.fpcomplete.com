<p class="lead">Teaching you how to use Haskell in an Enterprise environment</p>

FP Complete's corporate mission is to **increase the corporate
adoption of Haskell**. One of the primary challenges we've heard from
corporate users of Haskell is the need to *commercial support*.

FP Complete offers general [consulting
services](https://www.fpcomplete.com/consulting), but for many
companies a smaller engagement is all that's necessary. That's why
we've begun offering the [Haskell Success
Program](https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskellsuccess). Please see our
corporate site for contract details and pricing.

## For developers

From a developer's perspective, the purpose of this program is to
provide **training**, **review**, and **assistance** to a team of
developers. This can work at multiple levels, such as training a team
brand new to Haskell, or providing domain specific assistance to an
experienced Haskell team.

Our training typically follows our [Haskell
syllabus](/tutorial/syllabus), with adjustments made for your team's
skill level and goals.

## Promoting Haskell

This program is intended to tie in directly with our push to help
people [promote Haskell in their companies](/promote). Our training
offerings can help bypass some of the biggest concerns companies
typically raise around the risks of adopting Haskell.

## What you learn

You and your team will learn...

* recommended libraries for productive Haskell development
* improving performance of Haskell code
* setting up CI/CD for Haskell services
