# FP Complete's Haskell Homepage

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/haskell.fpcomplete.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/haskell.fpcomplete.com)

FP Complete is unifying all of its technology content under a single domain name, tech.fpcomplete.com. All URLs that used to live at https://haskell.fpcomplete.com/FOO now live at https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/FOO. This repo now simply provides automatic redirects.

In the future, we may move domains one more time, merging with our corporate website (www.fpcomplete.com), but that hasn't been decided yet. If we do so, automatic redirects from tech.fpcomplete.com will be set up.
